Generate the Spring Boot project according to the following requirements:

Project Generation Workflow
The project MUST be generated in the following sequential order as specified in the prompt:

Package Structure Creation -> pom.xml Generation -> Store Module Files Creation -> Feature Module Files Creation -> Facade Module Files Creation -> Boot Module Files Creation -> Inter-module Dependencies Configuration -> Global Error Resolution

Java File Generation Sequence
When creating *.java files, generate code sequentially following the requirements below:

1. Package and Import Section
    - Package declaration
    - All necessary import statements

2. Class Declaration Section
    - Required annotations for the file
    - Class declaration with proper modifiers

3. Field and Method Section
    - Field declarations or method implementations according to each file's responsibility

Mandatory Response Protocol:
If errors occur during file generation, continue with the project generation workflow sequence and resolve all errors only after the complete project structure is established.

Project Generation Guidelines
1. Project generation MUST be based on the metadata derived from the requested PRD and Rule files.
2. Package structure MUST be created based on `@package-structure.md` specifications.
3. Root and module-level pom.xml files MUST be generated according to `@pom-generation-rules`.
4. All files MUST be generated strictly based on metadata, and MUST NOT include any data not specified in the metadata.
