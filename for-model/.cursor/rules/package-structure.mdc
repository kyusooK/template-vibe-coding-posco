Package Structure Requirements for Code Generation

Please generate the following files according to the provided metadata, following the structure and file descriptions below.

At this time, since code generation requests are made by Aggregate unit in DDD Model, if the package structure that should be configured for each service is already completed, this process should be skipped.

```
/[serviceName] # Created by metadata name (ex: order, delivery, product ...)
  /[serviceName]-boot # Main Application Boot Module
  /[serviceName]-facade # REST API and External Interface Module
  /[serviceName]-feature # Business Logic and Domain Feature Module
  /[serviceName]-store # Data Persistence and Repository Module
  pom.xml # Root Maven multi-module configuration with poscodx-parent inheritance and 4 sub-modules (boot, facade, feature, store)
```
